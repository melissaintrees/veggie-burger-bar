# Veggie Burger Bar

## About

A full stack app that uses Node, Express, Handlebars, MySQl and Bootstrap to allows users to order, create and "virtually" eat veggie burgers. Please see the app deployed to Heroku [here](https://veggie-burger-bar.herokuapp.com/).

### How it works

Using a ORM, the app connects to MySql using 3 basic CRUD functions:

  1. READS the entries from a MySql database and dynamically adds them to the DOM.
  2. UPDATES the selected options upon user click of either "Order It," or "Eat It" which...
     * hits an Express route `/:id` which changes the item's state to either "devoured," or "ordered."
     * The page re-routes to index where the chosen item is in the section that reflects it's current state(via Handlebars).
  3. CREATES the user has the option of ordering a custom item which they can then virtually eat...
    * hits a post route in Express which then adds a new burger to the MySql database
    * the page re-routes to the index where the user creation is rendered in the "Eat It," section(via Handlebars).

## Visuals/Screen Shots

Though most of the logic is handled on the back end, Bootstrap was leveraged to provide a responsive and user friendly interface.
